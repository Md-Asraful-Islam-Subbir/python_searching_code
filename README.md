# Python Searching Algorithm Implementation & Propositional Logic

This repository contains Python implementations of various searching algorithms and propositional logic operations.

## Searching Algorithms

### 1. Linear Search

- Description: The linear search algorithm sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found.
- Implementation: [linear_search.py](searching_algorithms/linear_search.py)

### 2. Binary Search

- Description: Binary search is a more efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.
- Implementation: [binary_search.py](searching_algorithms/binary_search.py)

### 3. Depth-First Search (DFS)

- Description: DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- Implementation: [dfs.py](searching_algorithms/dfs.py)

### 4. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- Description: BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices at the current depth prior to moving on to the vertices at the next depth level.
- Implementation: [bfs.py](searching_algorithms/bfs.py)

### 5. Uniform Cost Search

- Description: Uniform Cost Search is a graph search algorithm that explores the lowest-cost path in a weighted graph.
- Implementation: [uniform_cost_search.py](searching_algorithms/uniform_cost_search.py)

### 6. Depth-Limited Search

- Description: Depth-Limited Search is a variant of DFS that limits the depth of exploration.
- Implementation: [depth_limited_search.py](searching_algorithms/depth_limited_search.py)

### 7. Iterative Deepening Search

- Description: Iterative Deepening Search combines the advantages of BFS and DFS by gradually increasing the depth limit.
- Implementation: [iterative_deepening_search.py](searching_algorithms/iterative_deepening_search.py)

### 8. Bidirectional Search

- Description: Bidirectional Search explores the search space from both the start and goal nodes simultaneously.
- Implementation: [bidirectional_search.py](searching_algorithms/bidirectional_search.py)

### 9. Local Search

#### a. Beam Search

- Description: Beam Search is a local search algorithm that explores a set number of most promising paths at each iteration.
- Implementation: [beam_search.py](searching_algorithms/beam_search.py)

#### b. Hill Climbing

- Description: Hill Climbing is a local search algorithm that iteratively moves towards the direction of increasing elevation in the search space.
- Implementation: [hill_climbing.py](searching_algorithms/hill_climbing.py)

#### c. Simulated Annealing

- Description: Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by annealing in metallurgy.
- Implementation: [simulated_annealing.py](searching_algorithms/simulated_annealing.py)

### 10. N-Queens Problem

- Description: Solving the N-Queens problem using backtracking.
- Implementation: [n_queens.py](searching_algorithms/n_queens.py)

## Propositional Logic

### 1. Propositional Logic Operations

- Description: This module includes implementations of basic propositional logic operations, such as AND, OR, NOT, etc.
- Implementation: [propositional_logic.py](propositional_logic/propositional_logic.py)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Md-Asraful-Islam-Subbir/python_searching_code



This should cover a wide range of searching algorithms. Customize it further if needed!
